# BITCollege

## Objective

Developed a business application using C#.NET, incorporating Language Integrated Query (LINQ) to interact with both database data and XML files. 
The project culminated in a web application built with ASP.NET, where I was introduced  Batch Record Processing and File I/O and encryption techniques. The application, 
constructed using Visual Studio 2019. It serves as a college registration system. It enables students and administrators to perform CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on courses and grades, providing a comprehensive registration service for a college.
